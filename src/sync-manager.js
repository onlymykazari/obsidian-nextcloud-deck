// The `rewriteWikilinksForDeck` helper that used to live here has been
// removed. It attempted to translate Obsidian's `![[…]]` embeds into
// something Deck's description renderer could handle. Two rounds of
// experimentation (CommonMark image link with an internal /apps/deck URL,
// then dropping the embed / substituting the filename caption) both
// mangled user content on the server side. Attachments are handled through
// the dedicated attachment API instead; description text is now shipped
// verbatim. See .trae/documents/attachment-rework-plan.md for the full
// history.
